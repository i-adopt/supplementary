# I-ADOPT to Ecological Metadata Language (EML)

Ecological Metadata Language (EML) is a widely used metadata standard in the ecological and environmental sciences. EML defines a comprehensive vocabulary and readable XML markup syntax for documenting (environment scienses) research data. Whenever possible, EML adopted entire trees of information in order to facilitate conversion of EML documents into other metadata languages. EML was designed with the following standards in mind: Dublin Core Metadata Initiative, the Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata (CSDGM from the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC)), the Biological Profile of the CSDGM (from the National Biological Information Infrastructure), the International Standards Organization’s Geographic Information Standard (ISO 19115), the ISO 8601 Date and Time Standard, the OpenGIS Consortiums’s Geography Markup Language (GML), the Scientific, Technical, and Medical Markup Language (STMML), and the Extensible Scientific Interchange Language (XSIL).

Attributes: recommendedUsage: any dataset that uses dataTable, spatialRaster, spatialVector, storedProcedure, view or otherEntity or in a custom module where one wants to document an attribute (variable). 

Variables that can be aligned with I-ADOPT are scattered in different EML modules and their elements (which could refer to iop:entity). The alingnments could be started from eml-Attribute and eml-unitTypeDefinitions.
